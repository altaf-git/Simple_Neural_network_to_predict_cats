# Simple_Neural_network_to_predict_cats
This is a simple neural network model with just one hidden layer to train my model on to predict Cat or Non Cat pictures.
I have used most basic technique for this just to ensure that people starting with neural network could get this easily.
No framework have been used in this and simple numpy and pandas have been used here.
So if you do like my work please give a star.
I have even provided Training and test data separately so no need to split.
